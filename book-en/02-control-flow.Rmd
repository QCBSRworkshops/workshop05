# Introduction to Control Flow

The basis of computer programming in any language begins with **control flow**. 

**Control flow** (or *flow of control*) is the order function calls, instructions, and statements are executed or evaluate when any program is running.

> Imagine that you would like to run an operation several times, until a condition is met. One option, is to rewrite the same code, while changing part of the syntax, that number of times you wish. Alternatively, we could write our code using *control flow*, and *iterate* through the same operation that will *evaluate* and *stop* until a certain condition is met. This last option usually implies in a much shorter, clearer and less complex form of writing code.

It is advantageous, for any programmer, to think in terms of in terms of **control flow**, and therefore have structured programs, because:

1. **The complexity and time of the task at hand is greatly decreased**;

2. **A logical structure also means that the code has increased clarity**;

3. **It also facilitates collaboration**, and therefore increases productivity.

### Building blocks of control flow

There are many building blocks of control flow programming:

- **Sequencing**, which executes or evaluates something sequentially;
- **Selection**, which performs operations `Ã¬f` or unless certain conditions are met; 
- **Iteration**, which `repeat`s an operation `while`, `until` or `for` a determined number of times; 
- **Procedural abstraction**, which involves a subroutine, nested call;
- Recursion
- **Concurrency**, which does several operations at the same time;
- Exception handling and speculation
- **Non-determinism**, which does an operation 

# Using flowcharts

Control-flow diagrams can be used to plan and represent the structure of programs. The main elements program-flowcharts are:

- A processing step, represented by the *rectangular box*;
- A decision step, usually denoted by a *diamond*; 
- The start and end steps, denoted by *rounded-edge rectangles*;
- *Arrows* indicating the direction and each step;
- *Labels* naming elements of the flowchart.
