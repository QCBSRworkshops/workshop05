# Control Flow

Program flow control can be simply defined as the order in which a
program is executed.

**Why is it advantageous to have structured programs?**

- It decreases the complexity and time of the task at hand;

- This logical structure also means that the code has increased
clarity;

- It also means that many programmers can work on one program.

**This means increased productivity**

Flowcharts can be used to plan programs and represent their structure

## Representing structure

The two basic building blocks of codes are the following:

**Selection**

Program's execution determined by statements

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
if
if else
```

**Iteration**

Repetition, where the statement will **loop** until a criteria is met

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for
while
repeat
```
