# (PART\*) Iteration {-}

# Iteration

Every time some operations have to be repeated, a loop may come in handy

Loops are good for:

-   doing something for every element of an object
-   doing something until the processed data runs out
-   doing something for every file in a folder
-   doing something that can fail, until it succeeds
-   iterating a calculation until it converges

## `for` loop

A `for` loop works in the following way:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for(val in sequence) {
  statement
  }
```

![](images/forloop.png){.align-center width="300"}

The letter i can be replaced with any variable name and the sequence can
be almost anything, even a list of vectors.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Try the commands below and see what happens:

for (a in c("Hello", "R", "Programmers")) {
  print(a)
}

for (z in 1:30) {
  a <- rnorm(n = 1, mean = 5, sd = 2)
  print(a)
}

elements <- list(1:3, 4:10)
for (element in elements) {
  print(element)
}
```

In the example below, R would evaluate the expression 5 times:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for(i in 1:5) {
  expression
}
```

In the example, every instance of m is being replaced by each number
between 1:10, until it reaches the last element of the sequence.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for(m in 1:10) {
  print(m*2)
}
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for(m in 1:5) {
  print(m*2)
}
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for(m in 6:10) {
  print(m*2)
}
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
x <- c(2,5,3,9,6)
count <- 0
for (val in x) {
  if(val %% 2 == 0) {
    count = count+1
  }
}
print(count)
```

For loops are often used to loop over a dataset. We will use loops to
perform functions on the CO2 dataset which is built in R.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data(CO2) # This loads the built in dataset

for (i in 1:length(CO2[,1])) { # for each row in the CO2 dataset
  print(CO2$conc[i]) # print the CO2 concentration
}

for (i in 1:length(CO2[,1])) { # for each row in the CO2 dataset
  if(CO2$Type[i] == "Quebec") { # if the type is "Quebec"
    print(CO2$conc[i]) # print the CO2 concentration
    }
}
```

**Tip 1.** To loop over the number of rows of a data frame, we can use
the function `nrow()`

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for (i in 1:nrow(CO2)) { # for each row in the CO2 dataset
  print(CO2$conc[i]) # print the CO2 concentration
}
```

**Tip 2.** If we want to perform operations on the elements of one
column, we can directly iterate over it

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for (p in 1:CO2$conc) { # for each row of the column "conc"of the CO2 df
  print(p) # print the p-th element
}
```

**Tip 3.** The expression within the loop can be almost anything and is
usually a compound statement containing many commands.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for (i in 4:5) { # for i in 4 to 5
  print(colnames(CO2)[i])
  print(mean(CO2[,i])) # print the mean of that column from the CO2 dataset
}
```

## `for` loops within `for` loops

In some cases, you may want to use nested loops to accomplish a task.
When using nested loops, it is important to use different variables as
counters for each of your loops. Here we used i and n:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for (i in 1:3) {
  for (n in 1:3) {
    print (i*n)
  }
}
```


## Getting better: using the `apply()` family

R disposes of the `apply()` function family, which consists of
vectorized functions that aim at minimizing your need to explicitly
create loops.

`apply()` can be used to apply functions to a matrix

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
(height <- matrix(c(1:10, 21:30),
                 nrow = 5,
                 ncol = 4))
}
apply(X = height,
      MARGIN = 1,
      FUN = mean)
?apply
```

### apply()

`lapply()` applies a function to every element of a **list**.

It may be used for other objects like dataframes, lists or vectors.

The output returned is a **list** (explaining the "l" in lapply) and has
the same number of elements as the object passed to it.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
SimulatedData <- list(
  SimpleSequence = 1:4,
  Norm10 = rnorm(10),
  Norm20 = rnorm(20, 1),
  Norm100 = rnorm(100, 5))
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Apply mean to each element
## of the list
lapply(SimulatedData, mean)

SimulatedData <- list(SimpleSequence = 1:4,
             Norm10 = rnorm(10),
             Norm20 = rnorm(20, 1),
             Norm100 = rnorm(100, 5))

# Apply mean to each element of the list
lapply(SimulatedData, mean)
```

### sapply()

`sapply()` is a 'wrapper' function for `lapply()`, but returns a
simplified output as a vector, instead of a list.

The output returned is a list (explaining the "l" in lapply) and has the
same number of elements as the object passed to it.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
SimulatedData <- list(SimpleSequence = 1:4,
             Norm10 = rnorm(10),
             Norm20 = rnorm(20, 1),
             Norm100 = rnorm(100, 5))

# Apply mean to each element of the list
sapply(SimulatedData, mean)
```

### mapply()

`mapply()` works as a multivariate version of `sapply()`.

It will apply a given function to the first element of each argument
first, followed by the second element, and so on. For example:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
lilySeeds <- c(80, 65, 89, 23, 21)
poppySeeds <- c(20, 35, 11, 77, 79)

# Output
mapply(sum, lilySeeds, poppySeeds)
```

### tapply()

`tapply()` is used to apply a function over subsets of a vector.

It is primarily used when the dataset contains dataset contains
different groups (i.e. levels/factors) and we want to apply a function
to each of these groups.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
head(mtcars)

# get the mean hp by cylinder groups
tapply(mtcars$hp, mtcars$cyl, FUN = mean)
```

## Challenge 2

You have realized that your tool for measuring uptake was not calibrated
properly at Quebec sites and all measurements are 2 units higher than
they should be.

1.- Use a loop to correct these measurements for all Quebec sites.

2.- Use a vectorisation-based method to calculate the mean CO2-uptake in
both areas.

++++ Challenge 2 : Answer\|

1.-Using for and if to correct the measurements:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for (i in 1:length(CO2[,1])) {
  if(CO2$Type[i] == "Quebec") {
    CO2$uptake[i] <- CO2$uptake[i] - 2
  }
}
```

2.- Using tapply() to calculate the mean for each group:

    tapply(CO2$uptake, CO2$Type, mean)

## Modifying iterations

Normally, loops iterate over and over until they finish.

Sometimes you may be interested in breaking this behaviour.

For example, you may want to tell R to stop executing the iteration when
it reaches a given element or condition.

You may also want R to jump certain elements when certain conditions are
met.

For this, we will introduce `break`, `next` and `while`.

### Modifying iterations: `break`

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for(val in x) {
  if(condition) { break }
  statement
}
```

![](images/break.png){.align-center}

### Modifying iterations: next

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for(val in x) {
  if(condition) { next }
  statement
}
```

![](images/next.png){.align-center}

Print the \$CO\_{2}\$ concentrations for \"chilled\" treatments and keep
count of how many replications were done.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
count <- 0

for (i in 1:nrow(CO2)) {
  if (CO2$Treatment[i] == "nonchilled") next
  # Skip to next iteration if treatment is nonchilled
  count <- count + 1
#  print(CO2$conc[i])
}
print(count) # The count and print command were performed 42 times.
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sum(CO2$Treatment == "nonchilled")
```

This could be equivalently written using a repeat loop and break

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
count <- 0
i <- 0
repeat {
      i <- i + 1
      if (CO2$Treatment[i] == "nonchilled") next  # skip this loop
      count <- count + 1
      print(CO2$conc[i])
      if (i == nrow(CO2)) break     # stop looping
    }
print(count)
```

## Modifying iterations: `while`

This could also be written using a `while` loop:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
i <- 0
count <- 0
while (i < nrow(CO2))
{
  i <- i + 1
  if (CO2$Treatment[i] == "nonchilled") next  # skip this loop
  count <- count + 1
  print(CO2$conc[i])
}
print(count)
```

## Challenge 3

You have realized that your tool for measuring concentration did not
work properly.

At Mississippi sites, concentrations less than 300 were measured
correctly, but concentrations equal or higher than 300 were
overestimated by 20 units!

Your mission is to use a loop to correct these measurements for all
Mississippi sites.

Tip. Make sure you reload the data so that we are working with the raw
data for the rest of the exercise:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data(CO2)
```

++++ Challenge 3: Answer\|Â 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for (i in 1:nrow(CO2)) {
  if(CO2$Type[i] == "Mississippi") {
    if(CO2$conc[i] < 300) next
    CO2$conc[i] <- CO2$conc[i] - 20
  }
}
```

\*Note: We could also have written it in this way, which is more concise
and clear\*

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for (i in 1:nrow(CO2)) {
  if(CO2$Type[i] == "Mississippi" && CO2$conc[i] >= 300) {
    CO2$conc[i] <- CO2$conc[i] - 20
  }
}
```

### Edit a plot using `for` and `if`

Let's plot uptake vs concentration with points of different colors
according to their type (Quebec or Mississippi) and treatment (chilled
or nonchilled).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
plot(x = CO2$conc, y = CO2$uptake, type = "n", cex.lab=1.4,
     xlab = "CO2 concentration", ylab = "CO2 uptake")
# Type "n" tells R to not actually plot the points.
for (i in 1:length(CO2[,1])) {
  if (CO2$Type[i] == "Quebec" & CO2$Treatment[i] == "nonchilled") {
    points(CO2$conc[i], CO2$uptake[i], col = "red")
  }
  if (CO2$Type[i] == "Quebec" & CO2$Treatment[i] == "chilled") {
    points(CO2$conc[i], CO2$uptake[i], col = "blue")
  }
  if (CO2$Type[i] == "Mississippi" & CO2$Treatment[i] == "nonchilled") {
    points(CO2$conc[i], CO2$uptake[i], col = "orange")
  }
  if (CO2$Type[i] == "Mississippi" & CO2$Treatment[i] == "chilled") {
    points(CO2$conc[i], CO2$uptake[i], col = "green")
  }
}
```

## Challenge 4

Generate a plot of showing concentration versus uptake where each plant
is shown using a different point.

**Bonus points** for doing it with nested loops!

++++ Challenge 4 Answer \|

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
plot(x = CO2$conc, y = CO2$uptake, type = "n", cex.lab=1.4, xlab = "CO2 concentration", ylab = "CO2 uptake") # Type "n" tells R to not actually plot the points.
plants <- unique(CO2$Plant)

for (i in 1:nrow(CO2)){ for (p in 1:length(plants)) { if (CO2$Plant[i] == plants[p]) { points(CO2$conc[i],
 CO2$uptake[i],
col = p) } } }
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
plot(x = CO2$conc, y = CO2$uptake, type = "n", cex.lab = 1.4,
     xlab = "CO2 Concentration", ylab = "CO2 Uptake")

plants <- unique(CO2$Plant)

for (i in 1:nrow(CO2)){
  for (p in 1:length(plants)) {
    if (CO2$Plant[i] == plants[p]) {
      points(CO2$conc[i], CO2$uptake[i], col = p)
    }
  }
}
