# (PART\*) Programming in `R` {-}

## Learning objectives

This workshop focuses on basic programming in R.

You will learn how to use control flow (`for` loops, `if`, `while`, `repeat`, and `apply()` family functions) methods to prevent code repetition, facilitate organization and run
simulations. 

You will also learn to write your own functions,
and tips to program efficiently.

1. Recognizing **control flow**;
2. Getting comfortable with testing conditions and performing iterations;
3. Developing your first functions in `R`;
4. Discovering how to accelerate your code;
5. Demonstrating useful `R` packages for biologists.

###                                                                             #
### This is an automatically generated script based on the code chunks from the #
### book for this workshop.                                                     #
###                                                                             #
### It is minimally annotated to allow participants to provide their comments:  # 
### a practice that we highly encourage.                                        #
###                                                                             #
### Note that the solutions to the challenges are also included in this script. #
### When solving the challenges by yourself, attempt to not scroll and peek at  #
### the solutions.                                                              #
###                                                                             #
### Happy coding!                                                               #

To prepare for this workshop, you must download and install the earliest RStudio and R versions. 

All workshop materials are found within the [Github repository for this workshop](github.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop05). This includes an [`R` script](https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/workshop05/workshop05-en/workshop05-en.R), which contains all code chunks shown in this book.

To reproduce the diagrams included in this workshop, you will need the `DiagrammeR` package. You can install and load it with the following command:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("DiagrammeR")

library(DiagrammeR)
```
