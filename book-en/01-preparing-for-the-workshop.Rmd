# (PART\*) Programming in `R` {-}

## Learning objectives

**Summary:** This workshop focuses on basic programming in R. In this
workshop, you will learn how to use control flow (for loops, if, while)
methods to prevent code repetition, facilitate organization and run
simulations. In addition, you will learn to write your own functions,
and tips to program efficiently. The last part of the workshop will
discuss packages that will not covered elsewhere in this workshop
series, but that may be of interest to participants.

###### 1. Recognizing **control flow**;
###### 2. Getting comfortable with testing conditions and performing iterations;
###### 3. Developing your first functions in `R`;
###### 4. Discovering how to accelerate your code;
###### 5. Demonstrating useful `R` packages for biologists.


# Preparing for the workshop

To prepare for this workshop, you must do the following steps:

Download the R script and data required for this workshop:

-   [R Script](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/_media/programming.r)

Make sure to load the following packages (see how in the R script):

-    [vegan (for multivariate
    analyses)](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html)

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("vegan")

library(vegan)
```

## Review: Vectors

<br>

.center[Recall [Workshop #1](https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/workshop01/workshop01-en/workshop01-en.html#55)?]

<br>


##### Numeric vectors 

```{r}
num.vector <- c(1, 4, 3, 
                9, 32, -4)
num.vector
```


##### Character vector

```{r}
char_vector <- c("blue", 
                 "red", 
                 "green")
char_vector
```


##### Logical vector

```{r}
bool_vector <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) # or c(T, T, F)
bool_vector
```



## Review: Data frames

We can begin by creating multiple vectors (remember [Workshop #1](https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/workshop01/workshop01-en/workshop01-en.html#55)):

```{r}
siteID <- c("A1.01", "A1.02", "B1.01", "B1.02")
soil_pH <- c(5.6, 7.3, 4.1, 6.0)
num.sp <- c(17, 23, 15, 7)
treatment <- c("Fert", "Fert", "No_fert", "No_fert")
```

<br>
We then combine them using the function `data.frame()`.

```{r}
my.first.df <- data.frame(siteID, soil_pH, num.sp, treatment)
```

```{r}
my.first.df
```


## Review: Lists

We can also create lists by combining the vectors we created before.

```{r}
  my.first.list <- list(siteID, soil_pH, num.sp, treatment)
```

```{r}
  my.first.list
```
